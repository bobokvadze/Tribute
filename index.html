            "The most important thing is, you must put everybody on notice that
            you’re here, and you are for real. I’m not a player that is just
            going to come and go. I’m not a player that is going to make an
            All-Star team one time, two times. I’m here to be an all-time great.
            Once I made that commitment and said, “I want to be one of the
            greatest ever”, then the game became everything for me."
